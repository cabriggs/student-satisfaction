If a student did not understand something he would tell them to go to his office hours instead of further explaining the concept to the advantage of the rest of the class.  At office hours Dr Briggs would provide very vague explanations often simply reworking a problem the same as before.  When demonstrating concepts he would skip the steps required by doing work in is head and only showing the start and end result of the problem.  Often times I would have to rely on the instructional videos in the homework to learn a concept. Many times I felt as if calculus was a prerequisite for taking calculus.,-3,I would have greatly appreciated Dr Briggs showing up to his office hours for the days before the final.

The refresher class could cover the algebra, trig, and geometry skills needed to master the calculus concepts learned in MA 241.  the instructor did his best with the time he was given and the office hours were very helpful.  i just think that since the math, and physics as well, are both so critical to the success of most, if not all, students it would be worth coming up with an affordable way to help students bridge the gap between high school and college.  i also want the school to understand that not all students are fresh out of high school, some of us HAD to take the military rout just so we can pay for tuition.  it would be nice to take a refresher course for math and physics on our own but some people cant afford that, we need  to rely on the GI bill to cover as much schooling as we can and taking extra classes means using up the GI bill and having to pay that much more out of pocket later on.  just a suggestion though. otherwise the class was great!"

I had to spend time nearly every single day studying and learning, and it was very comforting to know that even though I am struggling Dr. Briggs would always be there excited to help me learn, and help me not just regurgitate memorized formulas and patterns onto test, which is what I have done in nearly every math course ever, but to actually dive deeper into the study of Calculus.

The instructor tends to skip steps when doing examples and jump to conclusions without fully explaining why or how he got to the answer. He also focuses his course on challenging the student, which is fine, but this leads to lower grades. While he makes up for this by lowering what passing would be, since he realizes that his material is harder than normal, it doesn't help the students GPA or their confidence in their knowledge of the material. Even though I met average in the class, just looking at the grades, it felt to me that I was doing horribly, and I know some of my classmates felt the same.

He has a well prepared lesson plan each day and an established course outline, but will deviate from this on an ""as-needed"" basis. He is truly focused on how we as students receive and process the material instead of just getting through the lesson plan and moving on like many professors do. He is also available to help us outside of class even on weekends and encourages us to take advantage of this opportunity for extra help and guidance. This being my last class I need to graduate, I have interacted with many professors and he is definitely one of the most available and helpful professors that I have encountered. It is very apparent that he wants all of his students to succeed and will go out of his way to ensure that we do. He also has the ability, it seems, to put himself mentally in the students ""shoes"" to better explain the material to us. He uses examples and explains many things in multiple ways especially if the matter is particularly difficult or confusing. I suspect this material, being very abstract in nature, is difficult to teach effectively and requires a delicate and thought out process to do so.

Anyways, I can find the professor to be a bit intimidating and difficult to approach/talk to at times, It is likely because of how I present myself in the first place and how stressed and anxious I am. when I make eye contact with someone my mind tends to focus on the possible thoughts/perceptions they may be having about different aspects of our interaction or myself personally or any random thing instead of processing what they are actually saying to me. Because of this, I often do not respond well and find it difficult to support a constructive conversation. It is different with different people and it just so happens that I am uncomfortable with Dr. Briggs and this sounds really awful, but I hope this is not taken the wrong way because I have a lot of respect for him and think he is a super awesome and caring guy as well as an outstanding professor.",0,

His clear lecture notes and flexibility in ways of describing the concepts made the topics much more accessible.  He was always willing to go back to a previous example if it needed further explaining. Though sometimes he did it begrudgingly, he was even willing to explain concepts that were well below the level of expectation for the class (like a quick refresher on prime factorization when talking about relative primes). His eagerness to promptly provide feedback on homework in preparation for exams was also appreciated. His grading policy, for this class in particular, is perfect. The grading structure was more than fair, and balanced just well enough to make the class passable (if you put in the work) while remaining very challenging.  It was nice when he'd show a proof on a ""heavy"" concept and then allow a few extra moments for us to chew on it while we formulated questions, I think this was important in many cases for patching up holes in my understanding of certain topics as he presented them.",-1,"The only thing I wish he would have done a bit more was ""narrate"" (if you will) what he was doing while he was doing it, rather than writing out the proof and THEN explaining what he did. Though I feel this was a way to probe the class to make sure we were understanding, there were times I'd wished he'd have spent more time on the proof or steps of the proof. For most of the lemmas and corollaries this wasn't necessary, just on some of the more intricate proofs.",3,"Dr. Briggs is awesome! Very clear and precise.  He's one of the only math professors whose office hours I have actually frequented, I don't know whether to attribute that to his approachability or to the difficult subject material (probably both)."

Dr. Briggs also maintained student attention in a (comparatively) dry lecture by cracking an occasional joke or by talking about something completely unrelated.

A potential solution to this problem, would be that while you could still use the WebAssign functionality, also require to turn a hard copy of the work done for all applicable assignments.  This way, if all of the problems are correct, then the instructor could very quickly glance at the hand written notes to make sure all of the genuine and completed individually, but for the problems that were marked wrong the instructor could also fairly quickly find the work for that problem and give feedback or highlight where the students might have made some mistakes."

The homework problems which had their own walked-through solutions helped outline techniques and special cases which we didn't have the time to go over during class. Dr. Briggs's occasional tangents are positives for his class, since it snaps a student's brain out of the ""write what you see"" zone and into curious attention, and takes no significant amount of time away from the lecture itself. Commentary about philosophy or pizza delivery made without warning during a Calculus lecture has a tendency to that. Dr. Briggs also gives 30 seconds between example for students to finish writing down the problem and ask questions that they only saw after review of their work.

In other words the questions requires multiple skills to unravel the equations, but if a mistake is made or one skill is forgotten than the entire question is lost. I guess he's just training us how to apply the skills to more general equations, but what I end up doing is basically memorizing all the steps he shows during the office hours. He is never condescending, but sometimes I think often he overestimates how easy or straightforward a problem is. I can't decide whether I like or hate the fact that he lists all the exam questions. I like it because I know what questions will pop up on the exam. I hate it because it takes days of intense studying to do everything and, essentially I end up memorizing the problems.

If he was teaching a graduate student, where math was their area of specialty, I think he would be perfect as he teaches now. However, I think he talks over our heads a bit. By that I mean- he teaches as though we already know something about each concept rather than starting from scratch. He is always willing to go back and explain and start from scratch, but there is always confusion at the beginning for us. If he could speak in a ""dumber"" language (ie. explaining each notation short-hand, and slowly explaining each concept as if we know nothing) would have helped to grasp concepts sooner. As I wrote earlier, he was always willing to go back and do these things (which was awesome), but it wasn't exactly instinct.  I guess my only feedback for this section is for him to just ""dumb-it-down"" a little at the beginning and then speed up to where he started off.

16-17_SU,MA345,5,4,3,2,4,5,4,4,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,Dr. Briggs has a keen interest in helping every student overcome thier individual limitations to ensure success. He was also very interested in discovering what might be missing from the lecture as to make it more useful and effective for following classes.,0,Reader:  Below is my honest thoughts on improving this course (hey you asked me...). These are the opinions of a student who may not fully understand the intentions or expectations of the professional who is teaching this course. These opinions were not developed out of laziness or unwillingness to do  extra work. They were concived in the interest of learning more effectively and with less agrivation. :)  I feel that Dr. Briggs is an excellent teacher. If there were something to improve it would be the dependancy on offoce hours. There seemed to be half (slight exaggeration) of the class in his office during office hours to get help with homework or sample problems. Dr Briggs is an excellent teacher and does explain the material well during lectures. However due to the complex nature and difficulty of the material very little is digested during the lecture reqireing a lot of thought and explination to fully grasp the concepts. I would suggest two things to help with this. A) hold office hours in a class room. Have someone ask their question to those attending. See if another student can answer the question. Correct the teaching students when needed or go over that material in more depth with those in attendance. NOTE: Maybe suplement the lecture notes with the material covered in office hours if it was to vague or miss understood? B) offer additional supplemental learning aids with worked out examples of problems with answers written out in the same format as required in webassign. Webassign is a great tool for teachers but it has limmitations: i) It is extremely picky with the formatting of the answer. If you do not know exactly what is being asked (because we are not phd's :) ) then it is easy to have the right answer and get it wrong because we are not familiar with the correct format. ii) do a brief overview of each problem type in the homework in class. While the struggle helps you learn there was a lot more stuggle with not knowing what the question was even asking. For example if the question was asking for a color and you thought it was asking for the name of a fruit then you will get that question wrong even though you are capable of answering the color question if you knew that was what was asked. This could be prevented by explaining the problem and question in more depth on WA or going over them in class to clearly explain what is needed.,3,"Dr.Briggs is an amazing teacher. This course was very hard for me, but Dr Briggs did what he could to ensure my success. As a whole a lot of other students give Dr Briggs a bad reputation that I feel is wholly unmarrited. Some of the sample test problems I felt were more difficult than needed leverage more on difficult algebra and calculus that i felt detracted from being able to test the students abilities in the subject being taught. That said the test grading was very leinent to compensate for this. It would make the students feel much more confident i their abilities going into the test if the problems were more representative of similar homework problems or more generic problems that a student who just learned the material could clearly and methodically struggle through. Some of the sample problems could not even be solved by extremely capable web apps. This is a frustration as without knowing they cant be solved you spend countless hours attempting something that is unreasonable and unrealistic for a novice to comprehend let alone solve. Solutions to similar problems not on the test would help here as well.  Thanks for a great summer class!"

Not because he's strict, but because you really have to study and practice on your own time if you want to get a decent grade in his class. It's crucial that you take all of the notes that you can, and that you never miss a homework assignment. My advice? If you don't pass the preparedness exam in the beginning of the year: drop out.

During lectures, Professor Briggs would move on to each example really quickly, with little to no explanation for each step he took to get to each answer. It seemed that if you wanted an explanation, you had to ask many questions of how he got to each number or step. Even then, the course was very confusing, before tests, I would have to learn up to 8 different sections of work on my own, just because the examples in class were no where related to the notes and practice problems on the lecture docs.",-2,"I would say, personally, Professor Briggs needs to improve on his way of teaching. I understand it isn't a high school course, however he acts as if everyone has been taking calculus for 2 years and knows everything he is talking about. Professor Briggs moves very quickly, he needs to slow down a bit and make sure everything is explained so the exam does not look like material which has never been covered before. Even when going to talk during office hours, he just gave me answers, not really telling me how to solve the problem and show me necessary steps to solve the problem. I understand people teach differently, but it is as if he just shows us this is how you do this and wants the students to memorize the steps, not actually learn the material. I have had math teachers who make math interesting and easy, and math teachers that just lose me because they just dictate how to do problems without explanation and do not provide any further assistance.",-3,"For next semester classes, it would be a good idea to not skip steps in problems and to explain how you got from a to b to c, and so forth, not just write down everything then explain and go on a tangent about random movies.

But I simply could not learn calc II from him. His lectures are monotone and high - level. I'm so lost I can't even form a question, and he has such a strong understanding of math he moves pretty fast. I've been really struggling to grasp concepts, and honestly I get nothing from the lectures. Khan academy is my best bet.",-1,"He's a great guy, but maybe just not my style of professor considering I need more visuals, detail and interaction during lectures. I really needed more help this year, and Calc II is a monster."

When he briefly stops class to tell a short story or fact, it lets my brain take a quick brake from concentrating so hard and I can focus better after. The stories also make me feel more comfortable coming to office hours.",0,"I don't have any improvements about his teaching that comes to mind, but there was one thing that Dr. Briggs said that was false. He stated, during his office hours one day, that the television show Spongebob Squarepants was inspired off of Ween's aquatic themed album. I researched it and it wasn't so. The creator of Spongebob Squarepants had a degree in art and marine biology and created the show off of his own ideas. He did however, favor the band Ween. There is an episode where the main character, Spongebob, quotes a line of one of Ween's songs. The show does show an additional two of Ween's songs, one about tying shoes and the other, Ocean Man. While Spongebob Squarepants does showcase Ween a lot, it was not inspired by Ween.",0,"The first week, I would have liked to see the horse split apart again."
